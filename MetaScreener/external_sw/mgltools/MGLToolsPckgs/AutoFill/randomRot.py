#    Homogeneous Transformation Matrices and Quaternions.
#
#   A library for calculating 4x4 matrices for translating, rotating, reflecting,
#   scaling, shearing, projecting, orthogonalizing, and superimposing arrays of
#   3D homogeneous coordinates as well as for converting between rotation matrices,
#   Euler angles, and quaternions. Also includes an Arcball control object and
#   functions to decompose transformation matrices.
