# 2. Error code 2009:

The device driver under Solaris allocates kernel buffers dynamically.
Hence, it is possible for the device driver to be unable to allocate a 
kernel buffer with other applications consuming resources.
When this happens, error code 2009 is returned. To solve this problem
free up resources by closing applications and windows or increasing
system memory.
