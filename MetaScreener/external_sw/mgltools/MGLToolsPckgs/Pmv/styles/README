How to create a style

load a molecule
display the geometries you want
perfect the colors and rendering styles
save the Pmv session

edit the session file

remove uneeded commands (starting with self.xxx) such as reading the molecule
try reapplying the style by starting Pmv, loading the molecule and doing 
sourcing the file to make sure it still works

run python sessionToStyle.py stylefile molname
  e.g. python sessionToStyle.py Pmv/styles/style_01.py 1jff
  this will create Pmv/styles/style_01_style.py in which 1jff is replaced
  and the style will be a function call apply style that can be applied to
  any molecule using applyStyle('1jff', self) where self is the molecular
  viewer

edit the style by hand to:

1 - define the bnumber of molecules
2 - create a documentation string
3 - fix the signature of the applyStyle fucntion to reflect the number of 
    molecules

COMMON THINGS TO FIX:

1 - remove pivot, scale, translation, rotation, near, far, fov, lookAt,
    lookFrom and direction from camera state
2 - remove transformation on root object or comment our applying the state
    to root
3 - add setupUndo=0 to pmv commands since the undo of applyStyle will take of 
    that
